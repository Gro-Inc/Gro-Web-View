                        <p>We believe a person learns the most from a mentor who has already achieved what that person aspires to achieve. But it's
                            not always easy or possible to find or reach out to these people. So we've created an app with the sole purpose of
                            connecting those who want to learn with those who want to teach.</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Want to play a game?</span>
                        <p>With Gro you have a level that represents how much you've learned through the app. You gain points by conversing with
                            your mentors, colleagues and students. There are five levels to earn in any category and each level becomes harder and
                            harder to attain, but those with perseverence will have little problem reaching their goals.

                        <p>Some learn by seeing, some learn by doing, but most everyone learns by teaching. Both mentor and student
                            will gain experience from their sessions, but while students and colleagues will gain significant points in their
                            roles, mentors gains points faster than anybody else.
